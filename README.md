# hostOnNetwor-SSH
Check host on your network and SSH enabled machines 

This PowerShell and Python script accomplish the same mission. They both check your local network (/24) and ping all hosts in it, after hosts are recognized (stored in array (PowerShell), stored in list (Python)), we will check if port 22 is open.

Very powerfull PowerShell has become, but still RAW Sockets in Python works really great.
